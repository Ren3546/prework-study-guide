# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The main idea of this project is to simplify and organize helpful information for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built this project in order to establish a strong base in my journey to learn coding, and to have a useful tool to look back to whenever I need help. This solves the issue of having too much info at one time that can be disorganized and confusing especially for learners new to coding. It creates a space that is organized and is pleasant to look at. From doing this project I have learned coding is specific and detailed, but also extremely flexible and lets you create pretty much anything you can think of.

This Prework Study Guide can be used by reading through the notes of each type of programming language (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). If you would like to randomize which section to lookover, open the DevTools console and the JavaScript will tell you which language to study next!
